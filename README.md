Company Home Page with Flexbox<br>
Front end engineer challenge project<br>
<h2>Overview</h2>
This project is slightly different than others you have encountered thus far on Codecademy.<br>
Instead of a step-by-step tutorial, this project contains a series of open-ended requirements which describe the project you’ll be building.<br>
There are many possible ways to correctly fulfill all of these requirements, and you should expect to use the Internet, Codecademy, and other resources when you encounter a problem that you cannot easily solve.<br>

<h2>Project Goals</h2>
In this project, you’ll be using flexbox to design and build the layout for a company’s homepage.<br>
You can choose to build a new homepage for an existing company or imagine your own dream company!<br>
